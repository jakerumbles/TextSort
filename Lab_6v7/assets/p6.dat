Just a little more than a hundred years ago a poor man by the name of Crockett embarked
on board an emigrant ship in Ireland for the New World  He was in the humblest station
in life  But very little is known respecting his uneventful career excepting its tragical
close  His family consisted of a wife and three or four children  Just before he sailed or
on the Atlantic passage a son was born to whom he gave the name of John  The family 
probably landed in Philadelphia and dwelt somewhere in Pennsylvania for a year or two
in one of those slab shanties with which all are familiar as the abodes of the poorest class
of Irish emigrants

After a year or two Crockett with his little family crossed the almost pathless Alleghanies
Father mother and children trudged along through the rugged defiles and over the rocky
cliffs on foot  Probably a single pack horse conveyed their few household goods  The
hatchet and the rifle were the only means of obtaining food shelter and even clothing
With the hatchet in an hour or two a comfortable camp could be constructed which would
protect them from wind and rain  The campfire cheering the darkness of the night drying
their often wet garments and warming their chilled limbs with its genial glow enabled
them to enjoy that almost greatest of earthly luxuries peaceful sleep

The rifle supplied them with food  The fattest of turkeys and the most tender steaks of
venison roasted upon forked sticks which they held in their hands over the coals feasted
their voracious appetites  This to them was almost sumptuous food  The skin of the deer
by a rapid and simple process of tanning supplied them with moccasins and afforded
material for the repair of their tattered garments

We can scarcely comprehend the motive which led this solitary family to push on league
after league farther and farther from civilization through the trackless forests  At length
they reached the Holston River  This stream takes its rise among the western ravines of
the Alleghanies in Southwestern Virginia  Flowing hundreds of miles through one of the
most solitary and romantic regions upon the globe it finally unites with the Clinch River
thus forming the majestic Tennessee

One hundred years ago this whole region west of the Alleghanies was an unexplored and
an unknown wilderness  Its silent rivers its forests and its prairies were crowded with
game  Countless Indian tribes whose names even had never been heard east of the
Alleghanies ranged this vast expanse pursuing in the chase wild beasts scarcely more
savage than themselves

The origin of these Indian tribes and their past history are lost in oblivion  Centuries have
come and gone during which joys and griefs of which we now can know nothing visited
their humble lodges  Providence seems to have raised up a peculiar class of men among
the descendants of the emigrants from the Old World who weary of the restraints of
civilization were ever ready to plunge into the wildest depths of the wilderness and to
rear their lonely huts in the midst of all its perils privations and hardships

This solitary family of the Crocketts followed down the northwestern banks of the
Hawkins River for many a weary mile until they came to a spot which struck their fancy
as a suitable place to build their Cabin  In subsequent years a small village called
Rogersville was gradually reared upon this spot and the territory immediately around was
organized into what is now known as Hawkins County  But then for leagues in every
direction the solemn forest stood in all its grandeur  Here Mr  Crockett alone and unaided
save by his wife and children constructed a little shanty which could have been but little
more than a hunter's camp  He could not lift solid logs to build a substantial house  The
hard trodden ground was the only floor of the single room which he enclosed  It was
roofed with bark of trees piled heavily on which afforded quite effectual protection from
the rain  A hole cut through the slender logs was the only window  A fire was built in one
corner and the smoke eddied through a hole left in the roof  The skins of bears buffaloes
and wolves provided couches all sufficient for weary ones who needed no artificial opiate
to promote sleep  Such in general were the primitive homes of many of those bold
emigrants who abandoned the comforts of civilized life for the solitudes of the wilderness

They did not want for most of what are called the necessaries of life  The river and the
forest furnished a great variety of fish and game  Their hut humble as it was effectually
protected them from the deluging tempest and the inclement cold  The climate was genial
in a very high degree and the soil in its wonderful fertility abundantly supplied them with
corn and other simple vegetables  But the silence and solitude which reigned are
represented by those who experienced them as at times something dreadful

One principal motive which led these people to cross the mountains was the prospect of
an ultimate fortune in the rise of land  Every man who built a cabin and raised a crop of
grain however small was entitled to four hundred acres of land and a preemption right to
one thousand more adjoining to be secured by a land office warrant

In this lonely home Mr  Crockett with his wife and children dwelt for some months
perhaps years we know not how long  One night the awful yell of the savage was heard
and a band of human demons came rushing upon the defenceless family  Imagination
cannot paint the tragedy which ensued  Though this lost world ever since the fall of
Adam has been filled to repletion with these scenes of woe it causes one's blood to curdle
in his veins as he contemplates this one deed of cruelty and blood

The howling fiends were expeditious in their work  The father and mother were pierced
by arrows mangled with the tomahawk and scalped  One son severely wounded escaped
into the forest  Another little boy who was deaf and dumb was taken captive and carried
by the Indians to their distant tribe where he remained adopted into the tribe for about
eighteen years  He was then discovered by some of his relatives and was purchased back
at a considerable ransom  The torch was applied to the cabin and the bodies of the dead
were consumed in the crackling flames

What became of the remainder of the children if there were any others present in this
midnight scene of conflagration and blood we know not  There was no reporter to give us
the details  We simply know that in some way John Crockett who subsequently became
the father of that David whose history we now write was not involved in the general
massacre  It is probable that he was not then with the family but that he was a hired boy
of all work in some farmer's family in Pennsylvania

As a day laborer he grew up to manhood and married a woman in his own sphere of life
by the name of Mary Hawkins  He enlisted as a common soldier in the Revolutionary
War and took part in the battle of King's Mountain  At the close of the war he reared a
humble cabin in the frontier wilds of North Carolina  There he lived for a few years at but
one remove in point of civilization from the savages around him  It is not probable that
either he or his wife could read or write  It is not probable that they had any religious
thoughts that their minds ever wandered into the regions of that mysterious immortality
which reaches out beyond the grave  Theirs was apparently purely an animal existence
like that of the Indian almost like that of the wild animals they pursued in the chase

At length John Crockett with his wife and three or four children unintimidated by the
awful fate of his father's family wandered from North Carolina through the long and
dreary defiles of the mountains to the sunny valleys and the transparent skies of East
Tennessee  Here he came to a rivulet of crystal water winding through majestic forests
and plains of luxuriant verdure  Upon a green mound with this stream flowing near his
door John Crockett built his rude and floorless hut  Punching holes in the soil with a stick
he dropped in kernels of corn and obtained a far richer harvest than it would be supposed
such culture could produce  As we have mentioned the building of this hut and the
planting of this crop made poor John Crockett the proprietor of four hundred acres of
land of almost inexhaustible fertility

In this lonely cabin far away in the wilderness David Crockett was born He had then four
brothers  Subsequently four other children were added to the family

His childhood's home was more humble than the majority of the readers of this volume
can imagine  It was destitute of everything which in a higher state of civilization is
deemed essential to comfort  The wigwam of the Indian afforded as much protection
from the weather and was as well furnished as the cabin of logs and bark which sheltered
his father's family  It would seem from David Crockett's autobiography that in his
childhood he went mainly without any clothing like the pappooses of an Indian squaw

These facts of his early life must be known that we may understand the circumstances by
which his peculiar character was formed

He had no instruction whatever in religion morals manners or mental culture  It cannot be
supposed that his illiterate parents were very gentle in their domestic discipline or that
their example could have been of any essential advantage in preparing him for the
arduous struggle of life  It would be difficult to find any human being in a civilized land
who can have enjoyed less opportunities for moral culture than David Crockett enjoyed
in his early years
